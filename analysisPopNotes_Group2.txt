- Comparion of the Analysis Populations
	- You say there are anonmolies but what are they?
	- After Table 2 I'm unsure what you mean by differnece of 
	  the population from the random sample.
	- what is bolding indicate in Table 2??
	- For outcome variables and predictive variables consider 
	  making the first 2 paragraphs a dat dictionary for an 
	  appendix? It is a lot of text to take in and lists are
	  reasonably difficult to read
	- instead of a paranthetical "(likely selecting one from a lists
	  of possibilites)" consider using commas instead for more formal writing.
	- instead of saying discarded maybe just state the prelimary analysis shows
	  they are clearly not useful? current phrasing seems like it just wastes data
	
	- overall great description of the data and what we we are working with!
